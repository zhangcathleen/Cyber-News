### World Wide Web
On 2025 October 20, an outage affected Amazon Web Service ( AWS ) at 3:11 AM EST, which impacted many parts of the internet.[^1] By 6:35 AM ET, AWS reported the outage had "been fully mitigated, and most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now." AWS stated the underlying cause was due to DNS and recommended flushing DNS caches if there were still issues resolving DynamoDB service endpoints in US-EAST-1.[^2] AWS is the largest cloud provider today, with about 34% of the market share.[^3] The most recent global IT disruption was over a year ago -- in July 2024 -- when Crowdstrike published a "defect" in a update for their security product Falcon Sensor.[^4]

### North Korea ( DPRK )
Since February 2025, Google Threat Intelligence Group ( GTIG ) observed DPRK threat actor UNC5342 using 'EtherHiding' to deliver malware and facilitate cryptocurrency theft. This is the first time GTIG has seen a nation-state adopt this method, which emerged in September 2023 as part of UNC5142's financially motivated infection chain.[^5] EtherHiding involves embedding malicious code -- usually in the form of JavaScript payloads -- within a smart contract on a public blockchain. It is using public blockchains to conceal and control malware in ways that make the malware nearly impossible to dismantle, in this current era.[^6]
