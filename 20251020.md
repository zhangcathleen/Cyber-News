On 2025 October 20, an outage affected Amazon Web Service ( AWS ) at 3:11 AM EST, which impacted many parts of the internet.[^1] By 6:35 AM ET, AWS reported the outage had "been fully mitigated, and most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now." AWS stated the underlying cause was due to DNS and recommended flushing DNS caches if there were still issues resolving DynamoDB service endpoints in US-EAST-1.[^2] AWS is the largest cloud provider today, with about 34% of the market share.[^3] The most recent global IT disruption was over a year ago -- in July 2024 -- when Crowdstrike published a "defect" in a update for their security product Falcon Sensor.[^4]
