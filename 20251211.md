### Malware

On 10 December 2025, researchers at Elastic Security Labs published a report about NANOREMOTE, a novel Windows backdoor that uses Google Drive API to conduct command execution, discovery and enumeration, and data exfiltration.[^1] NANOREMOTE shares characteristics with malware linked to REF7707[^2] and FINALDRAFT[^3] implant.

REF7707 - Jewelbug or Earth Alux - was attributed to an intrusion on a Russian IT service provider's network lasting for five months; there was evidence of a software supply chain attack motivation.[^4]
