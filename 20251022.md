On 2025 October 21, Kapersky released a report detailing the cyberespionage campaign PassiveNeuron, which involved compromising government organization servers with advanced persistent threat ( APT ) implants.[^1] First reported in November 2024, PassiveNeuron used never-before-seen malware families -- "Neursite" and "NeuralExecutor" -- in a set of attacks aimed at government entities in Latin America and East Asia in June 2024.[^2] It has been unclear how the APT implants were deployed.[^3]
> "The PassiveNeuron campaign has been distinctive in the way that it primarily targets server machines," Kapersky researchers stated. "These servers, especially the ones exposed to the internet, are usually lucrative targets for APT, as they can serve as entry points into target organizations."
Kapersky recommends paying close attention to the protection of server machines; that the attack surface associated with these servers should be reduced to a minimum; and all server applications should be monitored to prevent emerging infections in a timely manner. They also recommend paying specific attention to the protecting applications against SQL injections and against web shells.
