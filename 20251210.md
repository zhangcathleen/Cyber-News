On 2025 December 3, the React Team disclosed CVE-2025-55182 - dubbed React2Shell - an critical security vulnerability in React Server Components.[^1] This unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affects server-side use of React.js and is rated a 10.0 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System.[^2] React2Shell can give an unauthenticated attacker RCE on the server if they craft a malicious HTTP request to any Server Function endpoint when it is deserialized^[Serialization is the process of turning an object into a data format. Deserialization is the reverse process - taking data structured in some format and rebuilding it into an object] [^3] by React.

React2Shell is present in versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 of:
- [react-server-dom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-webpack)
