### Vulnerabilities

On 2025 December 3, the React Team disclosed CVE-2025-55182 - dubbed React2Shell - an critical security vulnerability in React Server Components.[^1] This unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affects server-side usage of React.js and is rated a 10.0 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System.[^2] React2Shell enables an unauthenticated attacker arbitrary server-side code execution upon exploitation; RCE is achieved through crafting a malicious HTTP request to any Server Function endpoint when the vulnerable code deserializes HTTP payloads unsafely.[^3]
> Deserialization:
>
> Serialization is the process of turning an object into a data format that can be restored later. Deserialization is the reverse process - taking data that is structured in some format and rebuilding it into an object.[^4]

React2Shell is present in versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 of:
- [react-server-dom-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-webpack)
- [react-server-dom-parcel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-parcel)
- [react-server-dom-turbopack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-server-dom-turbopack?activeTab=readme)

Immediate action is required. A fix was introduced in versions 19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1. If any of the above packages are being used, upgrade to one of the fixed versions immediately. 

The following React frameworks & bundlers are affected:
- [next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next)
- [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
- [waku](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waku)
- [@parcel/rsc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parcel/rsc)
- [@vitejs/plugin-rsc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-rsc)
- [rwsdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rwsdk)

Instructions on how to update the frameworks & bundlers above are located on React's [website](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components#update-instructions).


Applications that are not affected by this vulnerability are as follows:
- The application's React code does not use a server
- The application does not use a framework, bundler, or bundler plugin that supports React Server Components
