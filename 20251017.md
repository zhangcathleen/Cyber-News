On 2025 September 17, WatchGuard released an advisory for CVE-2025-9242 -- an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability -- in the WatchGuard Fireware OS iked (Internet Key Exchange Daemon).[^1] This bug may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

watchTowr Labs described CVE-2025-9242 as "all the characteristics your friendly neighbourhood ransomware gangs love to see."[^2] It includes the following :
- affects an internet exposed service, Internet Key Exchange (IKE) v2
- can be exploited pre-authentication
- can execute arbitrary code on a perimeter appliance

This bug affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer:
- The Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured as such; and it was previously configured as such, even if both of the configurations have been deleted.
- If the Firebox cannot be immediately upgraded to a version of Fireway OS with the vulnerability resolution and was only configured with Branch Office VPN tunnels to static gateway peers, WatchGuard released -- as a temporary workaround --recommedations for [Secure Access to Branch Office VPNs that Use IPSec and IKEv2](https://techsearch.watchguard.com/KB?type=Article&SFDCID=kA1Vr000000DMXNKA4&lang=en_US).
