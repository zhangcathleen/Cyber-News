On 2025 September 17, WatchGuard released an advisory for an Out-of-bound Write vulnerability CVE-2025-9242 in the WatchGuard Fireware OS iked (Internet Key Exchange Daemon)[^1]. This bug may allow for arbitrary code execution by an remote unauthenticated attacker.

The team at watchTowr Labs described CVE-2025-9242 as "all the characteristics your friendly neighbourhood ransomware gangs love to see."[^2] This bug includes the following :
- will affect an internet exposed service
- is exploitable without authentication
- can execute arbitrary code on a perimeter appliance.

This affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer. Even if both of these configurations have deleted, if the Firebox was previously configured as such, that Firebox may continue to be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured. However, if the Firebox is only configured with the branch office VPN tunnels to a static gateway peer and the device cannot be immediately upgraded to a version of Fireway OS with the vulnerability resolution, WatchGuard has recommendations for a temporary workaround for [Secure Access to Branch Office VPNs that Use IPSec and IKEv2](https://techsearch.watchguard.com/KB?type=Article&SFDCID=kA1Vr000000DMXNKA4&lang=en_US).
