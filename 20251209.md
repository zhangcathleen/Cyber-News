### Malware

On 2025 December 8, researchers at Sysdig published findings on EtherRAT.[^1] This payload was recovered from a compromised Next.js application, which could be impacted downstream by the vulnerability React2Shell.[^2] 

EtherRAT is a persistent access implant a combination of capabilities that have not been previously observed in React2Shell exploitation:
- leveraging Ethereum smart contracts for command-and-control resolution
- deploying five independent Linux persistence mechanisms
- downloading own Node.js runtime from nodejs[.]org

Sysdig researchers discovered EtherRat has a significant overlap with a long-running North Korea-linked "Contagious Interview" tooling, which conducts weekly intrusions into the npm registry.[^3]

EtherRAT also represents an evolution in React2Shell exploitation, beyond opportunistic cryptomining and credential theft to persistent, stealthy access designed for long-term operations.[^4] And since attackers can combine techniques from multiple campaigns and dynamically modify their payloads, organizations cannot rely on signature-based detection or indicator blocking. Runtime threat detection is critical. Continuous monitoring is the most reliable defense against the evolving threat landscape.[^1]

Organizations running React Server Components or Next.js should take immediate action:[^1]
- Patch immediately: Update React to version 19.2.1 or later, and Next.js to patched versions. Rebuild and redeploy applications after updating.
- Hunt for persistence: Check for unauthorized systemd user services, XDG autostart entries, cron jobs, and bashrc/profile modifications on any system that may have been exposed.
- Monitor Ethereum RPC traffic: Unusual outbound connections to public Ethereum RPC endpoints from web application servers should be investigated.
- Deploy runtime detection: Signature-based detection is ineffective against malware that updates its own code. Runtime threat detection is critical for identifying this class of implant.
- Review application logs: Search for evidence of React2Shell exploitation attempts - unusual POST requests to RSC endpoints with malformed payloads.
-  Rotate credentials: If compromise is suspected, rotate all credentials accessible from the affected system, including cloud provider tokens, API keys, and SSH keys.
