# Cyber News

Hi

I am practicing my journalism and threat intelligence skills. This is also a  good way to stay informed on the cyber world.

Eventually, I would like to start practicing how to present these nitty gritty cyber information in a non-technical, non-scary way s.t. people who aren't in the cyber, or tech, world can engage and stay informed.

If anyone would like to engage in discussions or say "hi", Github's Issues feature might be the way:
