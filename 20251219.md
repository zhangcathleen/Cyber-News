### Cyberattacks

Officials in Nigeria arrested three individuals involved in attacks targeting major corporations such as Microsoft 365.[^1] One individual is the main developer for RacoonO365 (Storm-2246), a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit that created fake Microsoft O365 websites and stole over 5,000 accounts. Earlier in the year, Cloudflare dismantled the phishing network in a coordinated takedown with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit to seize 338 websites.[^2] RacconO365 would exfiltrate cookies, credentials, Microsoft O365 data, and any additional machine data, which would be shared with the threat actor over email.[^3]
