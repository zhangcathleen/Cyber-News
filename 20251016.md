On 2025 October 16, CISA added CVE-2025-54253 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. The Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms Code Execution Vulnerability is a critical security flaw with a CVSS score of 10.0.
This misconfiguration bug could result in arbitrary code execution. While Adobe is not aware of this issue being exploited in the wild, they acknowledged this and another vulnerability have a publicly available proof-of-concept.
AEM is a widely used enterprsise application platform. This vulnerability arises from improperly handled expressions in an exposed server, which allows attacker to bypass authentication and remotely execute arbitrary code.

Organizations running Adobe AEM Forms on JEE versions 6.5.23.0 or lower should take the following actions:
- System administrators can check if their instance by running this script on GitHub - Shivshantp / CVE-2025-54253-Exploit-Demo (https://github.com/Shivshantp/CVE-2025-54253-Exploit-Demo)
- Patch now : deploy Adobeâ€™s fixed version to AEM Forms on JEE 6.5.0-0108 or later; and fully restrict the /adminui/debug endpoint
- Harden access : block access to all debug/dev endpoints via firewalls and reverse proxies; ensure debug settings and servlets are disabled in all production deployments; use WAF/IDS to detect/drop requests containing debug=OGNL:*
- Additionally, FireCompass has a dedicated module its customers can use to scan for this injection vulnerability
